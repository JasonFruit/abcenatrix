<h1>The ABCenatrix</h1>
<h3>Â©2017 by Jason R. Fruit</h3>

<p>The ABCenatrix is a tool to manage ABC tunebooks.  With it, you can
view, hear, and print tunes, add them to and delete them from new and
existing tunebook, edit them, and enter new ones.</p>

<p>At this point, the only developer is me, Jason R. Fruit, but the
source code is
available <a href="https://github.com/JasonFruit/abcviewer">on
Github</a>, and I welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature
requests.</p>

<p>The code for the ABCenatrix was released under the terms of the MIT
License, which puts few limits on its re-use; you could even sell the
code for profit, if you think that will do you good (which it won't).
The current version is under version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, which is more restrictive.  This relicensing is the result of
PySide's instability and inconsistency across operating systems, which
was limiting the reliability of the application.  The GPL3-licensed
PyQt library is much better, even though it requires this regrettably
less-free license.</p>

<p>If you are unable to find the copy of the GNU General Public
License v.3 supplied with this application, please see it at <a
href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0">https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0</a>.</p>
