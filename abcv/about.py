<h1>The ABCenatrix</h1>
<h3>Â©2017 by Jason R. Fruit</h3>

<p>The ABCenatrix is a tool to manage ABC tunebooks.  With it, you can
view, hear, and print tunes, add them to and delete them from new and
existing tunebook, edit them, and enter new ones.</p>

<p>At this point, the only developer is me, Jason R. Fruit, but the
source code is
available <a href="https://github.com/JasonFruit/abcviewer">on
Github</a>, and I welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature
requests.</p>

<p>The code for the ABCenatrix is released under the terms of the MIT
License, which puts few limits on its re-use; you can even sell the
code for profit, if you think that will do you good (which it
won't).</p>

<p>If you are unable to find the copy of the MIT License supplied with
this application, please see it
